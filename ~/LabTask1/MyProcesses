When you start a program from the command line:
1. Your program's parent process is your shell (bash/zsh/tcsh)
2. The shell's parent process is the terminal emulator (like gnome-terminal, konsole, etc.)
3. The terminal emulator's parent process is the desktop environment's session manager or init/systemd (PID 1)
